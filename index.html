    <p id="about">
      Hello my name is Brandon Marella.
      <br /><br />I enjoy simplistic design, such as this site, which took 30
        minutes to develop, and is now my homepage.
      <br /><br />My free time consists of sitting in a Starbucks programming or
        learning something new and the occasional video game with friends.
      <br /><br />I am a student attending LCC in pursuit of a Bachelors in
        Computer Science and working with a Work/School schedule.
      <br /><br />My interests involve learning new technologies, along with
        what makes them tick. Due to this, I am a major Open Source advocate,
        and <a href="https://github.com/MarellaB">Github</a> can show this!
    </p>
    <p id="projects">
      Currently working on <a href="https://github.com/MarellaB/bigdrink">The
        Big Drink</a> which is a cli tool used to share and collaborate on
        Gulpfiles more easily.
      <br /><br />More to come!
    </p>
    <p id="work">
      Through the months of March to September of 2016 I worked for
        <a href="http://xngage.com/">Xngage</a>, a B2B E-Commerce
        company, as a Front End Developer.
        <br />Commonly working remote due to the
        extended commute, I gained much experience as to how B2B works and how
        to manage my time more effectively. This was also a fantastic view into
        the field and I am very grateful for the experience.
      <br /><br />My past work experience is limited, as I am still in school.
        However, I am looking for opportunities to grow and expand what I know.
      <br /><br />If you are looking for a junior web developer, contact me!
      <br /><br />If you are a non-profit in need of a website, also
        contact me, as I will do it for free! I have a large amount of
        appreciation for the work you do, and would be more than willing to help
        without a cost to you!
